## Graph representation
Graph represntation can be done in various ways, but most preffered choice depend upon the use case in a perticular problem. For exmaple if we need
to access the all the neighbour of a node then is more efficient in the case of the adjecency list compared to the matrix represntation.
# Distance between two vertices is the minimum pssible distance.
# Eccentricity of a node is the maximum among all the possible distance from nodes in the graph.
